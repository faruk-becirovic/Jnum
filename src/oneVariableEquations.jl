    bisect(a::Float64, b:Float64, f::Function[, e::Float64, n::Integer])

Compute the root of the given function using **Bisection method**.

Uses midpoint of the interval [`a`, `b`], replacing one of the
endpoinds with midpoint depending on the location of the root in
relation to the midpoint and repeting the process untill the
approximation `p` of the root of the function `f` is found
within the specified error margin.

#ARGUMENTS
- `a::Float64`: lower bound of the interval.
- `b::Float64`: upper bound of the interval.
- `f::function`: equation whose root needs to be found.
- `e::Float64`: optional, error tolerance ``ε`` for the method, default ``10^-5``.
- `n::Integer`: optional, upper bound on the number of itterations, default `100`.

# OUTPUT:
  * `p` - approximation of the root of the function `f` (Float64) or,
  * `-1` - if `n` the maximum number of iterations was exceeded.

newtons(f::Function, fp::Function, p0::Number, e::Number, n::Integer)

Compute the root of the given function using **Secant method**.

Compute the root of the given function using Newton's method.
Uses the point at which tangent line intersects x-axis to find the next approximate of the root of function 'f', 
as such it requires initial approximation `x0` and `fprime`, the derivative of function `f`.
Newton's method has very fast convergence provided a sufficiantly accurate initial approximation is chosen.

#ARGUMENTS
- `f::function`: function whose root needs to be found.
- `fp::function`: first derivative of a function whose root needs to be found.
- `p0::Float64`: first approximation of the root of a function.
- `e::Float64`: optional, error tolerance ``ε`` for the method, default ``10^-5``.
- `n::Integer`: optional, upper bound on the number of itterations, default `100`.


### OUTPUT:
  * `p` - approximation of the root of the function `f` (Float64) or,
  * `p` - if the first derivative if the function is `0` or,
  * `-1` - if `n` the maximum number of iterations was exceeded.

    secant(p0::Number, p1::Number, f::Function, e::Number, n::Integer)

Compute the root of the given function using **Secant method**.

Secant method, is an Extension of Newton's method.
Insted of using a tangent line, which requres knowledge of the function's derivative, Secant method uses two values of
the initial approximation `x0` and `x1`, to find secant line and uses the intersection of the secant line and x-axis
to find the next approximation.

#ARGUMENTS
- `p0::Float64`: first approximation of the root of a function.
- `p1::Float64`: second approximation of the root of a function.
- `f::function`: equation whose root needs to be found.
